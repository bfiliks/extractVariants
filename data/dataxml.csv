Life is but Life! And Death, but Death! Bliss is but Bliss, and Breath but Breath! And if indeed I fail, At least, to know the worst, is sweet! Defeat means nothing but Defeat, No drearier, can befall! And if I gain! Oh Gun at sea, Oh Bells, that in the steeples be! At first, repeat it slow! For Heaven is a different thing, Conjectured, and waked sudden in - And might extinguish me!
1	F171A   A fuzzy fellow, without feet - Yet doth exceeding run! Of velvet, is his Countenance - And his complexion, dun! Sometime, he dwelleth in the grass! Sometime, opon a bough, From which he doth descend in plush Opon the Passer-by! All this in summer - But when winds alarm the Forest Folk, He taketh Damask Residence - And struts in sewing silk! Then, finer than a Lady, Emerges in the spring! A Feather on each shoulder! You'd scarce recognize him! By men, yclept Caterpillar! By me! But who am I, To tell the pretty secret Of the Butterfly!

1	F175A   I cautious, scanned my little life - I winnowed what would fade From what w'd last till Heads like mine Should be a-dreaminga'dreaming laid. I put the latter in a Barn - The former, blew away. I went one winter morning And lo, my priceless Hay Was not opon the "Scaffold" - Was not opon the "Beam" - And from a thriving Farmer - A Cynic, I became. Whether a Thief did it - Whether it was the wind - Whether Deity's guiltless - My business is, to find! So I begin to ransack! How is it Hearts, with Thee? Art thou within the little Barn Love provided Thee?
1	F176A   If I could bribe them by a Rose I'd bring them every flower that grows From Amherst to Cashmere! I would not stop for night, or storm - Or frost, or death, or anyone - My business were so dear! If they w'd linger for a Bird My Tamborin were soonest heard Among the April Woods! Unwearied, all the summer long, Only to break in wilder song When Winter shook the boughs! What if they hear me! Who shall say That such an importunity May not at last avail? That, weary of this Beggar's face - They may not finally say, Yes - To drive her from the Hall?

Could we stand with that Old "Moses" - "Canaan" denied - Scan like him, the stately landscape On the other side - Doubtless, we should deem superfluous Many Sciences, Not pursued by learned Angels In scholastic skies! Low amid that glad Belles lettres Grant that we may stand - Stars, amid profound Galaxies - At that grand "Right hand"!
1	F17A   It's all I have to bring today - This, and my heart beside - This, and my heart, and all the fields - And all the meadows wide - Be sure you count - sh'd I forget Some one the sum could tell - This, and my heart, and all the Bees Which in the Clover dwell.
1	F180A   In Ebon Box, when years have flown To reverently peer - Wiping away the velvet dust Summers have sprinkled there! To hold a letter to the light - Grown Tawny - now - with time - To con the faded syllables That quickened us like Wine! Perhaps a Flower's shrivelled cheek Among it's stores to find - Plucked far away, some morning - By gallant - mouldering hand! A curl, perhaps, from foreheads Our constancy forgot - Perhaps, an antique trinket - In vanished fashions set! And then to lay them quiet back - And go about it's care - As if the little Ebon Box Were none of our affair!
1	F181B   A wounded Deer - leaps highest - I've heard the Hunter tell - 'Tis but the extasy of death - And then the Brake is still! The smitten Rock that gushes! The trampled Steel that springs! A Cheek is always redder Just where the Hectic stings! Mirth is the mail of Anguish - In which it cautious Arm, Lest Anybody spy the blood And "you're hurt" exclaim!
1	F182A   The sun kept stooping - stooping - low - The Hills to meet him - rose - On his part - what Transaction! On their part - what Repose!

1	F183A   I met a King this Afternoon! He had not on a Crown indeed - A little Palm leaf Hat was all, And he was barefoot, I'm afraid! But sure I am he Ermine wore Beneath his faded Jacket's blue - And sure I am, the crest he bore Within that Jacket's pocket too! For 'twas too stately for an Earl - A Marquis would not go so grand! 'Twas possibly a Czar petite - A Pope, or something of that kind! If I must tell you, of a Horse My freckled Monarch held the rein - Doubtless, an estimable Beast, But not at all disposed to run! And such a wagon! While I live Dare I presume to see Another such a vehicle As then transported me! Two other ragged Princes His royal state partook! Doubtless the first excursion These sovreigns ever took! I question if the Royal Coach Round which the Footmen wait Has the significance, on high, Of this Barefoot Estate!

1	F1A   Awake ye muses nine, sing me a strain divine, unwind the solemn twine, and tie my Valentine! Oh the Earth was made for lovers, for damsel, and hopeless swain, for sighing, and gentle whispering, and unity made of twain, all things do go a courting, in earth, or sea, or air, God hath made nothing single but thee in his world so fair! The bride, and then the bridegroom, the two, and then the one, Adam, and Eve, his consort, the moon, and then the sun; the life doth prove the precept, who obey shall happy be, who will not serve the sovreign, be hanged on fatal tree. The high do seek the lowly, the great do seek the small, none cannot find who seeketh on this terrestrial ball; The bee doth court the flower, the flower his suit receives, and they make a merry wedding, whose guests are hundred leaves; the wind doth woo the branches, the branches they are won, and the father fond demandeth the maiden for his son. The storm doth walk the seashore humming a mournful tune, the wave with eye so pensive, looketh to see the moon, their spirits meet together, they make them solemn vows, no more he singeth mournful, her sadness she doth lose. The worm doth woo the mortal, death claims a living bride, night unto day is married, morn unto eventide; Earth is a merry damsel, and Heaven a knight so true, and Earth is quite coquettish, and he seemeth in vain to sue. Now to the application, to the reading of the roll, to bringing thee to justice, and marshalling thy soul; thou art a human solo, a being cold, and lone, wilt have no kind companion, thou reap'st what thou hast sown. Hast never silent hours, and minutes all too long, and a deal of sad reflection, and wailing instead of song? There's Sarah, and Eliza, and Emeline so fair, and Harriet, and Susan, and she with curling hair! Thine eyes are sadly blinded, but yet thou mayest see six true, and comely maidens sitting opon the tree; approach that tree with caution, then up it boldly climb, and seize the one thou lovest, nor care for space, or time! Then bear her to the greenwood, and build for her a bower, and give her what she asketh, jewel, or bird, or flower; and bring the fife, and trumpet, and beat opon the drum - and bid the world Goodmorrow, and go to glory home!
1	F200A   The Rose did caper on her cheek - Her Boddice rose and fell - Her pretty speech - like drunken men - Did stagger pitiful - Her fingers fumbled at her work - Her needle would not go - What ailed so smart a little maid - It puzzled me to know - Till opposite - I spied a cheek That bore another Rose - Just opposite - another speech That like the Drunkard goes - A Vest that like her Boddice, danced - To the immortal tune - Till those two troubled - little Clocks Ticked softly into one.

Then I said softly to myself "That must have been the sun"! But how he set, I know not! There seemed a purple stile Which little yellow boys and girls Were Climbing all the while - Till when they reached the other side, A Dominie in gray Put gently up the evening bars And led the flock away!

1	F207A   I taste a liquor never brewed, From tankards scooped in pearl; Not Frankfort berries yield the sense Such a delirious whirl. Inebriate of air am I, And debauchee of dew;-- Reeling through endless summer days, From inns of molten blue. When landlords turn the drunken bee Out of the Fox-glove'sFoxglove's door, When butterflies renounce their drams, I shall but drink the more; Till seraphs swing their snowy hats, And saints to windows run, To see the little tippler Come staggering toward the sun.

1	F335A   Her smile was shaped like other smiles - The Dimples ran along - And still it hurt you, as some Bird Did hoist herself, to sing, Then recollect a Ball, she got - And hold opon the Twig, - Convulsive, while the Music crashed - Like Beads - among the Bog - A happy lip - breaks sudden - It does'nt state you how It contemplated - smiling - Just consummated - now - But this one, wears it's merriment So patient - like a pain - Fresh gilded - to elude the eyes Unqualified, to scan -
1	F336A   Before I got my eye put out I liked as well to see - As other Creatures, that have Eyes And know no other way - But were it told to me - today - That I might have the sky For mine - I tell you that my Heart Would split, for size of me - The meadows - mine - The Mountains - mine - All Forests - Stintless Stars - As much of Noon as I could take Between my finite eyes - The Motions of The Dipping Birds - The Morning's Amber Road - For mine - to look at when I liked - The News would strike me dead - So safer Guess - With just my soul opon the Window pane - Where other Creatures put their eyes - Incautious - of the Sun -

1	F337A   Of nearness to her sundered Things The Soul has special times - When Dimness - looks the Oddity - Distinctness - easy - seems - The Shapes we buried, dwell about, Familiar, in the Rooms - Untarnished by the Sepulchre, The Mouldering Playmate comes - In just the Jacket that he wore - Long buttoned in the Mold Since we - old mornings, Children - played - Divided - by a world - The Grave yields back her Robberies - The Years, our pilfered Things - Bright Knots of Apparitions Salute us, with their wings - As we - it were - that perished - Themself - had just remained till we rejoin them - And 'twas they, and not ourself That mourned -
1	F338A   Tie the strings to my Life, My Lord, Then, I am ready to go! Just a look at the Horses - Rapid! That will do! Put me in on the firmest side - So I shall never fall - For we must ride to the Judgment - And it's many a mile -And it's partly, down Hill - But never I mind theBridges steepest - And never I mind the Sea - Held fast in Everlasting Race - By my own Choice, and Thee - Good bye to the Life I used to live - And the World I used to know - Here's a keepsake for the HillsAnd kiss the Hills, for me, just once - NowThen - I am ready to go!
1	F339A   I like a look of Agony, Because I know it's true - Men do not sham Convulsion, Nor simulate, a Throe - The eyes glaze once - and that is Death - Impossible to feign The Beads opon the Forehead By homely Anguish strung.
1	F33A   Whether my bark went down at sea - Whether she met with gales - Whether to isles enchanted She bent her docile sails - By what mystic mooring She is held today - This is the errand of the eye Out opon the Bay.
1	F340A   I felt a Funeral, in my Brain, And Mourners to and fro Kept treading - treading - till it seemed That Sense was breaking through - And when they all were seated, A Service, like a Drum - Kept beating - beating - till I thought My mind was going numb - And then I heard them lift a Box And creak across my Brain my Soul With those same Boots of Lead, again, Then Space - began to toll, As all the Heavens were a Bell, And Being, but an Ear, And I, and Silence, some strange Race Wrecked, solitary, here - And then a Plank in Reason, broke, And I dropped down, and down - And hit a World, at everyCrash - plunge, And Got through -Finished knowing - then -
1	F341A   'Tis so appalling - it exhilirates - So over Horror, it half captivates - The Soul stares after it, secure - A Sepulchre, fears frost, no more -To know the worst, leaves no dread more - To scan a Ghost, is faint - But grappling, conquers it - How easy, Torment, now - Suspense kept sawing so - The Truth, is Bald - and Cold - But that will hold - If any are not sure - We show them - prayer - But we, who know, Stop hoping, now - Looking at Death, is Dying - Just let go the Breath - And not the pillow at your cheek So slumbereth - Others, can wrestle - Your's, is done - And so of Wo, bleak dreaded - come, It sets the Fright at liberty - And Terror's free - Gay, Ghastly, Holiday!
1	F342A   How noteless Men, and Pleiads, stand, Until a sudden sky Reveals the fact that One is rapt Forever from the eye - Members of the Invisible, Existing, while we stare, In Leagueless Opportunity, O'ertakeless, as the Air - Why did'nt we detainit - Them? The Heavens with a smile, Sweep by our disappointed Heads, But deign no syllable -Without a syllable -
1	F343A   When we stand on the tops of Things - And like the Trees, look down, The smoke all cleared away from it - And mirrorrs on the scene - Just laying light - no soul will wink Except it have the flaw - The Sound ones, like the Hills -stand up - shall stand - No lightning,drives - scares away - The Perfect, nowhere be afraid - They bear theirfearless - • tranquil - dauntless Heads, Where others, dare notwalk at noon - go at noon, Protected by their deeds - The Stars dare shine occasionally Opon a spotted World - And Suns, go surer, for their Proof, As ifa muscle - held an axle, held -
1	F344A   'Twas just this time, last year, I died. I know I heard the Corn, When I was carried by the Farms - It had the Tassels on - I thought how yellow it would look - When Richard went to mill - And then, I wanted to get out, But something held my will. I thought just how Red - Apples wedged The Stubble's joints between - And Carts went stooping round the fields To take the Pumpkins in - I wondered which would miss me, least, And when Thanksgiving, came, If Father'd multiply the plates - To make an even Sum - And would it blur the Christmas glee My stocking hang too high For any Santa Claus to reach The altitude of me - But this sort, grieved myself, And so, I thought the other way, How just this time, some perfect year - Themself, should come to me -
1	F345A   Afraid! Of whom am I afraid? Not Death - for who is He? The Porter of my Father's Lodge As much abasheth me! Of Life? 'Twere odd I fear a thing That comprehendeth me In one or two existences - As Deity decree -Just as the case may be - Of Resurrection? Is the East Afraid to trust the Morn With her fastidious forehead? As soon impeach my Crown!
1	F346A   I showed her Hights she never saw - "Would'st Climb," I said? She said - "Not so" - "With me -" I said - With me? I showed her Secrets - Morning's Nest - The Rope the Nights were put across - And now - "Would'st have me for a Guest"? She could not find her Yes - And then, I brake my life - And Lo, A Light, for her, did solemn glow, The larger, as her face withdrew - And could she, further, "No"?
1	F346B   He showed me Hights I never saw - "Would'st Climb" - He said? I said, "Not so" - "With me -" He said - "With me"? He showed me secrets - Morning's Nest - The Rope the Nights were put across - "And now, Would'st have me for a Guest"? I could not find my "Yes" - And then - He brake His Life - And lo, A light for me, did solemn glow - Thelarger - steadier, as my face withdrew - And could I further "No"?
1	F347A   I dreaded that first Robin, so, But He is mastered, now, I'm some accustomed to Him grown, He hurts a little, though - I thought if I could only live Till that first Shout got by - Not all Pianos in the Woods Had power to mangle me - I dared not meet the Daffodils - For fear their Yellow Gown Would pierce me with a fashion So foreign to my own - I wished the Grass would hurry - So when 'twas time to see - He'd be too tall, the tallest one Could stretch to look at me - I could not bear the Bees should come, I wished they'd stay away In those dim countries where they go, What word had they, for me? They're here, though; not a creature failed - No Blossom stayed away In gentle deference to me - The Queen of Calvary - Each one salutes me, as he goes, And I, my childish Plumes, Lift, in bereaved acknowledgement Of their unthinking Drums -
1	F348A   I would not paint - a picture - I'd rather be the One It's bright impossibility To dwell - delicious - on - And wonder how the fingers feel Whose rare - celestial - stir - provokesEvokes so sweet a torment - Such sumptuous - Despair - I would not talk, like Cornets - I'd rather be the One Raised softly toHorizons the Ceilings - Andby - out, and easy on - Through Villages of Ether - Myselfupborne • upheld • sustained endued Balloon By but a lip of Metal - The pier to my Pontoon - Nor would I be a Poet - It's finer - Own the Ear - Enamored - impotent - content - The License to revere, Aluxury privilege so awful What would the Dower be, Had I the Art to stun myself With Bolts - of Melody!
1	F349A   He touched me, so I live to know That such a day, persuaded so -Accepted so -permitted so, I perishedI dwelt -I groped opon his breast - It was a boundless place to me And silenced, as the awful Sea Puts minor streams to rest. And now, I'm different from before, As if I breathed superior air - Or brushed a Royal Gown - My feet, too, that had wandered so - My Gypsy face - transfigured now - To tenderer Renown - Into this Port, if I might come, Rebecca, to Jerusalem, Would not so ravished turn - Nor Persian, baffled at her shrine Lift such a Crucifixal sign To her imperial Sun.
1	F34A   Taken from men - this morning - Carried by men today - Met by the Gods with banners - Who marshalled her away - One little maid - from playmates - One little mind from school - There must be guests in Eden - All the rooms are full - Far - as the East from Even - Dim - as the border star - Courtiers quaint, in Kingdoms Our departed are.
1	F350A   I had the Glory - that will do - An Honor, Thought can turn her to When lesser Fames invite - With one long "Nay" - Bliss' early shape Deforming - Dwindling - Gulphing up - Time's possibility -
1	F351A   She sights a Bird - she chuck - leschuckles - She flattens - then she crawls - She runs without the look of feet - Her eyes increase to Balls - Her Jaws stir - twitching - hungry - Her Teeth can hardly stand - She leaps, but Robin leaped the first - Ah, Pussy, of the Sand, The Hopes so juicy ripening - You almost bathed your Tongue - When Bliss disclosed a hundredwings - Toes - And fled with every one -
1	F352A   They leave us with the Infinite - But He is not a man, His Fingers are the size of Fists - His Fists, the size of men. And whom he foundeth with his Arm As Himmaleh, shall stand - Gibraltar's everlasting shoe Poised lightly on his Hand - So trust Him, Comrade! You for you, and I For you and me - Eternity is Ample - And quick enough, If true -
1	F352B   They leave us with the Infinite. But He - is not a man - His fingers are the size of fists - His fists, the size of men - And whom he foundeth, with his Arm As Himmaleh, shall stand - Gibraltar's everlasting Shoe Poised lightly on his Hand, So trust him, Comrade - You for you, and I, for you and - - meand - me Eternity is ample, And quick enough, if true.
1	F353A   I'm ceded - I've stopped being Their's - The name They dropped opon my face With water, in the country church Is finished using, now, And They can put it with my Dolls, My childhood, and the string of spools, I've finished threading - too - Baptized, before, without the choice, But this time, consciously, Of Grace - Unto supremest name - Called to my Full - The Crescent dropped - Existence'ssurmise wholeRim • Eye Arc, filled up, Withjust one one - small Diadem - My second Rank - too small the first - Crowned -whimpering • dangling Crowing - on my Father's breast - An insufficient QueenA too unconscioushalf unconscious Queen But this time - Adequate - Erect, Withpower Will to choose, Or to reject, And I choose, just aThrone Crown -
1	F354A   If Anybody's friend be dead It's sharpest of the theme The thinking how they walked alive - At such and such a time - Their costume, of a Sunday, Some manner of the Hair - A prank nobody knew but them Lost, in the Sepulchre - How warm, they were, on such a day, You almost feel the date - So short way off it seems - And now - they're Centuries from that - How pleased theylooked were, at what you said! You try toreach touch the smile Andmix dip your fingers in the frost - When was it - Can you tell - You asked the Company to tea - Acquaintance - just a few - And chatted close with this Grand Thing That dont remember you - Past Bows, and Invitations - Past Interview, and Vow - Past what Ourself canunderstand estimate - That - makes the Quick of Wo!
1	F355A   It was not Death, for I stood up, And all the Dead, lie down - It was not Night, for all the Bells Put out their Tongues, for Noon. It was not Frost, for on my KneesFlesh I felt Siroccos - crawl - Nor Fire - for just twomy marble feet Could keep a Chancel, cool - And yet, it tasted, like them all, The Figures I have seen Set orderly, for Burial, Reminded me, of mine - As if my life were shaven, And fitted to a frame, And could not breathe without a key, And 'twas like Midnight, some - When everything that ticked - has stopped - And space stares - all around - Or Grisly frosts - first Au - tumnAutumn morns, Repeal the Beating Ground - But, most, like Chaos - Stopless - cool - Without a Chance, or spar - Or even a Report of Land - To justify - Despair.
1	F356A   If you were coming in the Fall, I'd brush the Summer by With half a smile, and half a spurn, As Housewives do, a Fly. If I could see you in a year, I'd wind the months in balls - And put them each in separate Drawers, For fear the numbers fuse - If only Centuries, delayed, I'd count them on my Hand, Subtracting, till my fingers dropped Into Van Dieman's Land. If certain, when this life was out - That your's and mine, should be - I'd toss it yonder, like a Rind, And take Eternity - But, now, uncertain of the length Of this, that is between, It goads me, like the Goblin Bee - That will not state - it's sting.
1	F357A   I felt my life with both my hands To see if it was there - I held my spirit to the Glass, To prove it possibler - I turned my Being round and round And paused at every pound To ask the Owner's name - For doubt, that I should know the sound - I judged my features - jarred my hair - I pushed my dimples by, and waited - If they - twinkled back - Conviction might, of me - I told myself, "Take Courage, Friend - That - was a former time - But we might learn to like the Heaven, As well as our Old Home"!
1	F358A   Perhaps I asked too large - I take - no less than skies - For Earths, grow thick as Berries, in my native Town - My Basket holds - just - Firmaments - Those - dangle easy - on my arm, But smaller bundles - Cram.
1	F359A   A bird came down the walk; He did not know I saw; He bit an angle-wormangleworm in halves And ate the fellow raw. And then he drank a dew From a convenient grass, And then hopped sidewise to a wall, To let a beetle pass. He glanced with rapid eyes That hurried all around; They looked like frightened beads, I thought; He stirred his velvet head Like one in danger, cautious. I offered him a crumb, And he unrolled his feathers And rowed him softer home Than oars divide the ocean, Too silver for a seam - Or butterflies, off banks of noon, Leap, plashless as they swim.
1	F359B   A Bird came down the Walk - He did not know I saw - He bit an Angleworm in halves And ate the fellow, raw, And then he drank a Dew From a Convenient Grass - And then hopped sidewise to the Wall To let a Beetle pass - He glanced with rapid eyes That hurried all around - They looked like frightened Beads, I thought - He stirred his Velvet Head Like One in danger, Cautious, I offered him a Crumb And he unrolled his feathers And rowed him softer home - Than Oars divide the Ocean, Too silver for a seam - Or Butterflies, off Banks of Noon Leap, plashless as they swim.

1	F35A   Sleep is supposed to be By souls of sanity - The shutting of the eye. Sleep is the station grand Down wh' on either hand - The Hosts of Witness stand! Morn is supposed to be By people of degree - The breaking of the Day! Morning has not occurred! That shall Aurora be East of Eternity! One with the banner gay, One in the red array - That is the Break of Day!

1	F360A   The Soul has Bandaged moments - When too appalled to stir - She feels some ghastly Fright come up And stop to look at her - Salute her, with long fingers - Caress her freezing hair - Sip, Goblin, from the very lips The Lover - hovered - o'er - Unworthy, that a thought so mean Accost a Theme - so - fair - The soul has moments of escape - When bursting all the doors - She dances like a Bomb, abroad, And swings opon the Hours, As do the Bee - delirious borne - Long Dungeoned from his Rose - Touch Liberty - then know no more - But Noone, and Paradise The Soul's retaken moments - When, Felon led along, Withirons - shackles on the plumed feet, Andrivets - staples, in the song, The Horror welcomes her, again, These, are not brayed of Tongue -
1	F361A   Like Flowers, that heard the news of Dews, But never deemed the dripping prize Awaited their - low Brows - Or Bees - that thought the Summer's name Some rumor of Delirium, No Summer - could - for Them - Or Arctic Creatures, dimly stirred - By Tropic Hint - some Travelled Bird imported -Imported to the Wood - Or Wind's bright signal to the Ear - Making that homely, and severe, Contented, known, before - The Heaven - unexpected come, To Lives that thought the Worshipping A too presumptuous Psalm -

1	F363A   I know a place where Summer strives With such a practised Frost - She - each year - leads her Daisies back - Recording briefly - "Lost" - But when the South Wind stirs the Pools And struggles in the lanes - Her Heart misgives Her, for Her Vow - And she pours soft Refrains Into the lap of Adamant - And spices - and the Dew - That stiffens quietly to Quartz - Opon her Amber Shoe -
1	F364A   As far from pity, as com - plaintcomplaint - As cool to speech - as stone - As numb to Revelation As if my Trade were Bone - As far from Time - as History - As near yourself - Today - As Children, to the Rainbow's scarf - Or Sunset's Yellow play To eyelids in the Sepulchre - How dumb the Dancer lies - While Color's Revelations break - And blaze - the Butterflies!
1	F365A   I know that He exists. Somewhere - in silence - He has hid his rare life From our gross eyes. 'Tis an instant's play - 'Tis a fond Ambush - Just to make Bliss Earn her own surprise! But - should the play Prove piercing earnest - Should the glee - glaze - In Death's - stiff - stare - Would not the fun Look too expensive! Would not the jest - Have crawled too far!
1	F366A   He strained my faith - Did he find it supple? Shook my strong trust - Did it then - yield? Hurled my belief - But - did he shatter - it? Racked - with suspense - Not a nerve failed! Wrung me - with Anguish - But I never doubted him - 'Tho'Tho' for what wrong He did never say - Stabbed - while I sued His sweet forgiveness - Jesus - it's your little "John"! Why - Slay - Me?Dont you know - me?

1	F370A   Within my Garden, rides a Bird Opon a single Wheel - Whose spokes a dizzy music make As 'twere a travelling Mill - He never stops, but slackens Above the Ripest Rose - Partakes without alighting And praises as he goes, Till every spice is tasted - And then his Fairy Gig Reels in remoter atmospheres - And I rejoin my Dog, And He and I, perplex us If positive, 'twere we - Or bore the Garden in the Brain This Curiosity - But He, the best Logician, Refers myduller - clumsy eye - To just vibrating Blossoms!

I'd rather suit my foot Than save my Boot - For yet to buy another Pair Is possible, At any store - But Bliss, is sold just once. The Patent lost None buy it any more - Say, Foot, decide the point! The Lady cross, or not? Verdict for Boot!
1	F372A   After great pain, a formal feeling comes - The Nerves sit ceremonious, like Tombs - The stiff Heart questions 'was it He, that bore,' And 'Yesterday, or Centuries before'? The Feet, mechanical, go round - A Wooden way Of Ground, or Air, or Ought - Regardless grown, A Quartz contentment, like a stone - This is the Hour of Lead - Remembered, if outlived, As Freezing persons, recollect the Snow - First - Chill - then Stupor - then the letting go -
1	F373A   This World is not conclusion. A Species stands beyond - Invisible, as Music - But positive, as Sound - It beckons, and it baffles - Philosophy, dont know - And through a Riddle, at the last - Sagacity, must go - Toprove it - guess it, puzzles scholars - To gain it, Men have borne Contempt of Generations And Crucifixion, shown - Faith slips - and laughs, and rallies - Blushes, if any see - Plucks at a twig of Evidence - And asks a Vane, the way - Much Gesture, from the Pulpit - Sure -Strong Hallelujahs roll - Narcotics cannot still theMouse - Tooth That nibbles at the soul -

It's cooler than the dawn - The Daisies dare to come here - And birds can flutter down - So when you are tired - Or - perplexed - or cold - Trust the loving promise Underneath the mould, Cry "it's I," "take Dollie," And I will enfold! "Dollie" (line 17) was a pet name for Susan Dickinson, to whom a copy may have been sent, though none is known.

1	F421A   It ceased to hurt me, though so slow I could not see theAnguish - trouble go - But only knew by looking back - That something - had obscured the Track - Nor when it altered, I could say, For I had worn it, every day, As constant as the Childish frock - I hung opon the Peg, at night. But not the Grief - that nestled Close As Needles - ladies softly press To Cushions Cheeks - To keep their place - Nor what consoled it, I could trace - Except, whereas 'twas Wilderness - It's better - almost Peace -

1	F423A   The first Day's Night had come - And grateful that a thing So terrible - had been endured - I told my Soul to sing - She said her strings were snapt - Her Bow - to atoms blown - And so to mend her - gave me work Until another Morn - And then - a Day as huge As Yesterdays in pairs, Unrolled it's horror in my face - Until it blocked my eyes - My Brain - begun to laugh - I mumbled - like a fool - And tho' 'tis Years ago - that Day - My Brain keeps giggling - still. And Something's odd - within - That person that I was - And this One - do not feel the same - Could it be Madness - this?
1	F424A   The Color of the Grave is Green - The Outer Grave - I mean - You would not know it from the Field - Except it own a Stone - To help the fond - to find it - Too infinite asleep To stop and tell them where it is - But just a Daisy - deep - The Color of the Grave is white - The outer Grave - I mean - You would not know it from the Drifts - In Winter - till the Sun - Has furrowed out the Aisles - Then - higher than the Land The little Dwelling Houses rise Where Each - has left a friend - The Color of the Grave within - The Duplicate - I mean - Not all the snows c'd make it white - Not all the Summers - Green - You've seen the Color - maybe - Opon a Bonnet bound - When that you met it with before - The Ferret - Cannot find -
1	F425A   'Twas like a Maelstrom, with a notch, That nearer, every Day, Kept narrowing it's boiling Wheel Until the Agony Toyed coolly with the final inch Of your delirious Hem - And you dropt, lost, When something broke - And let you from a Dream - As if a Goblin with a Guage - Kept measuring the Hours - Until you felt your Second Weigh, helpless, in his Paws - And not a Sinew - stirred - could help, And Sense was setting numb - When God - remembered - and the Fiend Let go, then, Overcome - As if your Sentence stood - pronounced - And you were frozen led From Dungeon's luxury of Doubt To Gibbets, and the Dead - And when the Film had stitched your eyes A Creature gasped "RepreiveReprieve"! Which Anguish was the utterest - then - To perish, or to live?

1	F428A   We grow accustomed to the Dark - When Light is put away - As when the Neighbor holds the Lamp To witness her Good bye - A Moment - We uncertain step For newness of the night - Then - fit our Vision to the Dark - And meet the Road - erect - And so of larger - Darknesses - Those Evenings of the Brain - When not a Moon disclose a sign - Or Star - come out - within - The BavestBravest - grope a little - And sometimes hit a Tree Directly in the Forehead - But as they learn to see - Either the Darkness alters - Or something in the sight Adjusts itself to Midnight - And Life steps almost straight.
1	F429A   You'll know it - as you know 'tis Noon - By Glory - As you do the Sun - By Glory - As you will in Heaven - Know God the Father - and the Son.

1	F437A   I never felt at home below, And in the handsome skies I shall not feel at home I know I don'tdont like Paradise!

I spilt the dew - But took the morn; I chose this single star From out the wide night's numbers - Sue - forevermore!
